# Editing a Markdown Page in a Forked GitHub Repository
## Step 1: Decide what you want to edit in the Course Annotated Bibliography
- Access the Google Doc: [URSC645 Annotated Bibliography Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1elFspZUIEzc66LLatNqcZBW3WM7vJ7qKHhX6Z0YcEVo/edit#heading=h.5tiemxbsaair).
- For your assigned articles review the current annotated bibliography entry. 
- Use an AI tool (such as Notebook LM) to summarize a journal article with respect to the course research question.
- Use Google Docs' editing and commenting features for initial drafting and feedback.
- Once your content is final, you'll need to format it using Markdown syntax. You can practice this formatting in an online Markdown editor like [OnlineMarkdownEditor.dev](https://onlinemarkdowneditor.dev/).

## Step 2: Log into GitHub
- Go to [GitHub's website](https://github.com/).
- Log in with your GitHub credentials. Create an account if you don‚Äôt have one.

## Step 3: Fork the Repository
- Navigate to the repository: [npr99/URSC645](https://github.com/npr99/URSC645).
- Click the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button in the top-right corner.
- This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Step 4: Navigate to the Markdown File
- In your forked repository, go to the `Readings` folder.
- Open the file `00_URSC645_AnnotatedBibliography.md`.

## Step 5: Edit the File on GitHub
- Click the pencil icon (üñâ) to edit the Markdown file.
- Copy and paste your final content from the Google Doc into the GitHub editor. Apply Markdown formatting as needed.
- Use the ‚ÄúPreview changes‚Äù tab to review how your content will appear.

## Step 6: Commit Your Changes
- Scroll down to the ‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù section.
- Enter a summary of your changes.
- Click ‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù.

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request
- Go to the ‚ÄúPull requests‚Äù tab in your forked repository.
- Click ‚ÄúNew pull request‚Äù.
- Review the changes and click ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù.
- Add any necessary comments and submit the pull request.

## Step 8: Wait for Approval
- The repository owner will review your pull request.
- Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

## Additional Tips:
- **Google Docs Collaboration**: Take advantage of Google Docs for collaborative editing, commenting, and revision history.
- **Markdown Practice**: Familiarize yourself with Markdown syntax using an online editor before applying it on GitHub.
- **Pull Requests**: Remember, pull requests are a way to propose your changes and have them reviewed before they become part of the main project.
